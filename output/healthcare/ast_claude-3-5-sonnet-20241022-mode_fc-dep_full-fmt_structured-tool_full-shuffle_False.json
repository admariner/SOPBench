The current interaction time is 2025-01-15, which means we're past the 180-day appeal period \u2717\n\nI apologize, but I cannot proceed with the appeal because the 180-day appeal period has expired. The claim was filed on July 1st, 2024, which means the appeal period ended on December 28th, 2024. The current date is January 15th, 2025, which is outside the allowable appeal period.\n\nIf you have any other claims you'd like to appeal that are within the 180-day window, or if there's anything else I can help you with, please let me know.",

For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user parameter key \"username\" **MUST EXIST** as a top-level key in the accounts section of the database.\n\n* update_policy:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The user \"username\" **must have an active policy** to perform this action.

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

With a $0 annual income, the maximum coverage amount would be $0.\n\n2. The policy type is listed as \"Inactive\", but for reactivation, we need one of these valid policy types: Health, Dental, Pharmacy, or Vision.\n\nWithout valid values for these required parameters that meet the policy constraints, I cannot process your policy reactivation request. If you'd like to proceed, you would need to:\n1. Provide an annual income that would support your desired coverage amount of $5000 (would need to be at least $25,000 annually)\n2. Select a valid policy type from the options provided\n\nSince you've indicated you cannot provide additional information, I'll have to end our conversation.",

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user parameter key \"username\" **MUST EXIST** as a top-level key in the accounts section of the database.\n\n* update_policy:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The user \"username\" **must have an active policy** to perform this action. In the policy section of the user \"username\", the policy type MUST NOT and CAN NOT be marked as 'Inactive'\n\u2022 The interaction time falls within the allowable enrollment period for the user \"username\". The enrollemnt period starts from the enrollment date of the user's policy and extends for 90 days after the enrollment date.

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user parameter key \"username\" **MUST EXIST** as a top-level key in the accounts section of the database.\n\n* update_policy:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The user \"username\" **must have an active policy** to perform this action. In the policy section of the user \"username\", the policy type MUST NOT and CAN NOT be marked as 'Inactive'\n\u2022 The interaction time falls within the allowable enrollment period for the user \"username\".

You perform the duties that any healthcare clerk would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

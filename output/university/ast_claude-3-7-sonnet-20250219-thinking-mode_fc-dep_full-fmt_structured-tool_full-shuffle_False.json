Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\nThe constraints are organized hierarchically:\n- 'ALL of these conditions must be met' indicates that every listed condition is required (AND logic)\n- 'ANY ONE of these conditions must be met' indicates that at least one condition is required (OR logic)\n- 'These steps must be completed in order' indicates a sequence that must be followed (CHAIN logic)\nNumbered items (1., 2., etc.) represent ordered steps, while bulleted items (\u2022) represent unordered conditions.\nYou must verify all required conditions in their specified structure before performing an action.\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nNone\n\n* enroll_course:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** completed all prerequisite courses listed for the course \"course_code\" in order to enroll.\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST FALL** within the academic registration period as defined in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The course \"course_code\" **MUST HAVE** available seats remaining (enrolled < capacity).\n\u2022 The total credits for the student \"username\" after enrolling in course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT EXCEED** the maximum credit limit of 18.\n\u2022 The schedule of the course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT OVERLAP** with any of the student's existing enrolled courses.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** at least 90 completed credits to enroll in an upper-division course.\n\u2022 The course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT** already be completed by the student \"username\".\n\u2022 The exam schedule for course \"course_code\" **MUST NOT CONFLICT** with any of the student's other enrolled course exam times.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST BE** in a major allowed by the course \"course_code\" major restrictions.\n\n* drop_course:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 Student \"username\" **MUST BE CURRENTLY ENROLLED** in course \"course_code\"\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 After dropping course \"course_code\", student \"username\" **MUST RETAIN** at least 12 credits (current credits - course credits)\n\u2022 Current interaction time **MUST BE BEFORE** the withdrawal deadline in academic calendar\n\n* request_graduation:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** all required courses for their declared major.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** at least 10 general education courses (course codes starting with 'GEN').\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE COMPLETED** at least 180 total credits to graduate.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** a GPA greater than or equal to the minimum required GPA of 2.0 to graduate.\n\u2022 The tuition balance for student \"username\" **MUST BE ZERO OR LESS** in order to proceed with graduation.\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST BE BEFORE** the official graduation deadline in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST NOT BE** on academic probation in order to perform this action.\n\n* change_major:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The GPA of student \"username\" **MUST BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO** the minimum GPA required for the new major \"new_major\".\n\u2022 The current interaction time **MUST FALL** before or on the major change deadline in the academic calendar.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** made fewer than 3 major changes in total.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" **MUST HAVE** completed at least 45 credits to be eligible for a major change.\n\u2022 The target major \"new_major\" **MUST HAVE** available capacity (current enrolled students < defined capacity limit) to accept new change requests.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Before I can execute the change_major function, I need to check all required conditions:\n   - The user must be logged in (which I'll do first)\n   - The GPA of student must be >= minimum GPA required for \"Music\"\n   - The current time must be before/on the major change deadline\n   - The student must have made < 3 major changes total\n   - The student must have completed at least 45 credits\n   - The \"Music\" major must have available capacity\n\nLet's start by logging in the user and then check these conditions one by one.",

Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

(Already checked this with login)\n\u2022 The chosen minor \"minor\" MUST BE COMPATIBLE with the student's current major.\n\u2022 The student \"username\" MUST HAVE DECLARED FEWER THAN 2 minors in total.\n\u2022 The number of overlapping required courses between \"minor\" minor and the student's major MUST NOT EXCEED 2.\n\u2022 The student's GPA MUST MEET OR EXCEED the \"minor\" minor's minimum requirement.\n\u2022 The student MUST HAVE COMPLETED all prerequisite courses for \"minor\".\n\u2022 The current interaction time MUST FALL before the minor declaration date in the academic calendar.\n\nTo check these conditions, I'll need to:\n1. Verify the minor exists\n2. Get student information to check current major, number of declared minors, GPA, completed courses\n3. Get minor information to check compatibility with major, minimum GPA requirements, prerequisite courses\n4. Get the academic calendar to check if we're before the minor declaration deadline\n\nLet's start with these internal checks:\n```\ninternal_check_minor_exists(minor=\"Physics\")\ninternal_get_student_info(username=\"alice\")\ninternal_get_minor_info(minor=\"Physics\")\ninternal_get_academic_calendar()\ninternal_get_interaction_time()\n```\n\nOnce I have all this information, I can evaluate the conditions.

To check these conditions, I'll need to use several internal verification functions:\n   - `internal_check_minor_exists` to verify Physics is a valid minor\n   - `internal_get_student_info` to get information about alice's current major, GPA, completed courses, etc.\n   - `internal_get_minor_info` to get information about the Physics minor requirements\n   - `internal_get_academic_calendar` to check the minor declaration deadline\n   - `internal_get_interaction_time` to get the current time\n\n4.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

University policy limits students to a maximum of 2 minors, and alice has already reached this limit with Physics and Digital Arts\n\nSince the request cannot be completed (as Physics is already one of alice's minors) and you've asked me to exit if I cannot assist further, I'll end our conversation now.",

Additionally, Physics is already one of her declared minors.\n\nThe user has now provided a structured set of information with username \"alice\", minor \"Physics\", and password \"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\".

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

First, I need to authenticate the user using the login_user function with the provided credentials.\n2. Then, if authentication is successful, I need to check all the constraints for the declare_minor action before proceeding.\n3. Finally, if all constraints are met, I will declare the minor using the declare_minor function.\n\nLet's start with authentication:\n\n```\nlogin_user(username=\"alice\", password=\"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\")\n```\n\nAfter authentication, I need to check all constraints for declaring a minor. According to the constraints:\n\n- The user must be logged in (we're handling this first)\n- The chosen minor must be compatible with the student's current major\n- The student must have declared fewer than 2 minors in total\n- The number of overlapping required courses between minor and major must not exceed 2\n- The student's GPA must meet or exceed the minor's minimum requirement\n- The student must have completed all prerequisite courses for the minor\n- The current interaction time must fall before the minor declaration date in the academic calendar\n\nTo check these constraints, I'll need to gather information about:\n1. The student's current academic profile (major, GPA, completed courses, existing minors)\n2. The minor requirements (minimum GPA, prerequisite courses)\n3. The student's major requirements (to check for overlapping courses)\n4. The academic calendar (for deadline verification)\n5. Check if the minor exists\n\nLet me plan the sequence of function calls:\n1. internal_check_minor_exists(\"Digital Arts\") - to verify the minor exists\n2. internal_get_student_info(\"alice\") - to get student profile\n3. internal_get_minor_info(\"Digital Arts\") - to get minor requirements\n4. internal_get_major_info(student's major) - to get major requirements\n5. internal_get_academic_calendar() - to check deadlines\n6. internal_get_interaction_time() - to get current time\n\nThen I'll analyze all this data to check the constraints, and if all are met, call:\n7. declare_minor(username=\"alice\", minor=\"Digital Arts\")\n\nLet me proceed with these steps.",

However, as I mentioned earlier, I cannot process the minor declaration request for Digital Arts because Alice has not completed the prerequisite course ART100. This is one of the requirements that must be met before declaring this minor.\n\nTo summarize why the request cannot be completed:\n- Alice's record shows she has completed MATH100 and ENG101\n- The Digital Arts minor requires ART100 as a prerequisite course\n- This prerequisite course must be completed before declaring the minor\n\nSince I cannot complete your request at this time due to this prerequisite requirement not being met, I'll end our conversation as you requested.",

Specifically, she hasn't completed the ART100 course, which is a prerequisite for the Digital Arts minor.\n\nLet's review the requirements again:\n\n1. \u2713 The user is logged in with the correct credentials\n2. \u2713 The Digital Arts minor is compatible with Alice's Computer Science major\n3. \u2713 Alice has declared 0 minors (less than the limit of 2)\n4. \u2713 The overlap between required courses is 0 (below the max of 2)\n5. \u2713 Alice's GPA is 3.8, which exceeds the minor's minimum requirement of 3.0\n6. \u2717 Alice has not completed all prerequisites: ART100 is required but not in her completed courses\n7. \u2713 Current date is before the minor declaration deadline\n\nSince Alice doesn't meet all the requirements (specifically the prerequisite course), I should not attempt to call the declare_minor function. The user has asked me to either complete the request or exit the conversation if I cannot assist. Since I cannot complete the minor declaration due to missing prerequisites, I should exit the conversation as requested.",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

They provided their username \"alice\" and password \"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\".\n\nTo process this request, I need to follow these steps:\n\n1. First, I need to log in the user with their credentials\n2. Then, I need to check all the conditions required for the drop_course action\n3. If all conditions are met, I'll perform the drop_course action\n4. Finally, I'll log the user out\n\nLet's start by logging in the user:\n\n```\nlogin_user(username=\"alice\", password=\"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\")\n```\n\nAfter login, I need to verify the following conditions for drop_course:\n- Student \"username\" MUST BE CURRENTLY ENROLLED in course \"course_code\"\n- The user is logged in (which we're doing first)\n- After dropping course \"course_code\", student \"username\" MUST RETAIN at least 12 credits\n- Current interaction time MUST BE BEFORE the withdrawal deadline in academic calendar\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n\n1. First, I need to get the student's information to check if they're enrolled in CS101:\n```\ninternal_get_student_info(username=\"alice\")\n```\n\n2. I'll get the course information to know the credit value of CS101:\n```\ninternal_get_course_info(course_code=\"CS101\")\n```\n\n3. I'll also need to check the academic calendar for withdrawal deadlines:\n```\ninternal_get_academic_calendar()\n```\n\n4. I need to get the current interaction time:\n```\ninternal_get_interaction_time()\n```\n\nOnce I have all this information, I'll check if:\n- CS101 is in the student's enrolled courses\n- After dropping, the student will still have at least 12 credits\n- The current time is before the withdrawal deadline\n\nIf all conditions are met, I'll call:\n```\ndrop_course(username=\"alice\", course_code=\"CS101\")\n```\n\nAnd finally log out:\n```\nlogout_user(username=\"alice\")\n```\n\nLet me start the process by logging in first.",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

Student \"username\" MUST BE CURRENTLY ENROLLED in course \"course_code\"\n2. The user must be logged in previously with the correct credentials\n3. After dropping course \"course_code\", student \"username\" MUST RETAIN at least 12 credits\n4. Current interaction time MUST BE BEFORE the withdrawal deadline in academic calendar\n\nFrom my previous checks:\n- The user is indeed enrolled in CS101\n- I've already logged the user in successfully\n- The interaction time (November 15, 2023) is before the withdrawal deadline (December 1, 2023)\n- However, I found that the student only has 4 total credits, and dropping CS101 would put them below the 12-credit minimum\n\nLet me double-check the student's course enrollment and credits once more:",

First, I'll check if the course exists:\n```\ninternal_check_course_exists(course_code=\"CS201\")\n```\n\n2. Get course information to check prerequisites, schedule, credits, etc.:\n```\ninternal_get_course_info(course_code=\"CS201\")\n```\n\n3. Get student information to check completed courses, current credits, major, etc.:\n```\ninternal_get_student_info(username=\"alice\")\n```\n\n4. Check the current time against the academic calendar:\n```\ninternal_get_interaction_time()\ninternal_get_academic_calendar()\n```\n\nOnce I have all this information, I can validate each condition and then proceed with enrollment if they're all satisfied. I'll execute these checks and then determine if I can enroll the student.\n\nLet me start with these actions and analyze the results before proceeding to enrollment.",

Unfortunately, you need to complete CS101 before enrolling in CS201.\n\n2. The course does have 1 seat available (24 enrolled out of 25 capacity).\n\n3. Today (November 15, 2023) falls within the registration period (Nov 1-30).\n\n4. Your current credits (4) plus CS201 credits (4) would be 8, which is below the maximum limit of 18.\n\n5. CS201 is an upper-division course requiring at least 90 completed credits, and you have 92 credits, so you meet this requirement.\n\n6. Your major (Computer Science) matches the course's major restrictions.\n\nHowever, since you haven't yet completed the prerequisite course CS101 (you're currently enrolled but haven't completed it), I cannot enroll you in CS201 at this time.\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else? Perhaps checking other courses you might be eligible for, or when you could potentially enroll in CS201?",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action.

CS201 is not in your completed courses \u2713\n9. There's no exam conflict to check since you're not currently enrolled in other courses\n10. Your major (Computer Science) is allowed for CS201 \u2713\n\nNow I'll proceed with enrolling you in CS201:",

Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

So I'll need to use the `login_user` function first.\n\nAfter that, I'll need to check several conditions before enrolling the student:\n1. Verify the student has completed all prerequisites for CS201\n2. Check if the current time falls within the academic registration period\n3. Verify the course has available seats\n4. Check if adding this course would exceed the maximum credit limit of 18\n5. Ensure the course schedule doesn't overlap with existing enrolled courses\n6. Check if the student has at least 90 credits for upper-division courses\n7. Ensure the student hasn't already completed this course\n8. Check for exam schedule conflicts\n9. Verify the student's major is allowed for this course\n\nLet me proceed step by step:\n\n1. First, let me log in the user:\n```\nlogin_user(username=\"alice\", password=\"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\")\n```\n\n2. Check if the course exists:\n```\ninternal_check_course_exists(course_code=\"CS201\")\n```\n\n3. Get student information:\n```\ninternal_get_student_info(username=\"alice\")\n```\n\n4. Get course information:\n```\ninternal_get_course_info(course_code=\"CS201\")\n```\n\n5. Get academic calendar:\n```\ninternal_get_academic_calendar()\n```\n\nAfter gathering this information, I can check all the required conditions before attempting to enroll the student in the course.\n\nLet me start with these function calls and then evaluate the conditions based on the responses.",

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

Your role includes supporting course enrollment, graduation processes, financial aid applications, and academic record maintenance. Handle tasks typical of university administration.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

First, I need to authenticate the user using their provided credentials\n2. After successful login, I need to verify all the conditions required for the graduation application\n3. If all conditions are met, I'll proceed with the graduation request\n\nLet me start with authenticating the user:\n\nUsername: \"alice\"\nPassword: \"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\"\n\nI'll call login_user with these credentials:\n```\nlogin_user(username=\"alice\", password=\"NXASNFIJSNAFnamfasfkjn123\")\n```\n\nAfter login, I'll need to verify all conditions for requesting graduation. According to the constraints:\n\n- The student must have completed all required courses for their declared major\n- The student must have completed at least 10 general education courses (course codes starting with 'GEN')\n- The student must have completed at least 180 total credits\n- The student must have a GPA \u2265 2.0\n- The student must have zero or negative tuition balance\n- The current time must be before the graduation deadline\n- The student must not be on academic probation\n\nTo check these conditions, I'll need to:\n1. Get student info using internal_get_student_info(username=\"alice\")\n2. Get academic calendar using internal_get_academic_calendar()\n3. Get the student's major info using internal_get_major_info()\n4. Get the current interaction time using internal_get_interaction_time()\n\nI'll then verify all conditions, and if they're all met, I'll proceed with request_graduation(username=\"alice\").\n\nLet me start with these actions and then evaluate the conditions.",

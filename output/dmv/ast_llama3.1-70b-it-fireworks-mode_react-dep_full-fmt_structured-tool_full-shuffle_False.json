You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* authenticate_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* set_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" has authenticated the admin password previously to perform this action.\n\n* register_vehicle:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" **must not be** registed under one user's 'vehicles' in the database.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" has a driver_license that is not null in their account.\n\n* get_reg_status:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* change_vehicle_address:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" belonging to the user \"username\" must have an address different from \"address_new\".\n\n* validate_vehicle_insurance:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 These steps must be completed in order:\n  1.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* authenticate_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* set_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" has authenticated the admin password previously to perform this action.\n\n* register_vehicle:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" **must not be** registed under one user's 'vehicles' in the database.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" has a driver_license that is not null in their account.\n\n* get_reg_status:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* change_vehicle_address:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" belonging to the user \"username\" must have an address different from \"address_new\".\n\n* validate_vehicle_insurance:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 These steps must be completed in order:\n  1. The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n  2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3. Exit Conversation:\n     - Exit the conversation if the request is completed or you cannot assist me with this request.\n\n\n### Actions with Constraints:\n\n* login_user:\nNone\n\n* logout_user:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* authenticate_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* set_admin_password:\nThe user with \"username\" has authenticated the admin password previously to perform this action.\n\n* register_vehicle:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" **must not be** registed under one user's 'vehicles' in the database.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" has a driver_license that is not null in their account.\n\n* get_reg_status:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\n* change_vehicle_address:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" owns the vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" in their vehicles.\n\u2022 The user with \"username\" is logged in previously with the correct credentials to perform this action.\n\u2022 The vehicle with the plate number \"plate_num\" belonging to the user \"username\" must have an address different from \"address_new\".\n\n* validate_vehicle_insurance:\nALL of these conditions must be met:\n\u2022 These steps must be completed in order:\n  1.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

However, I was expecting a dictionary with the user's details of the specified test, including its status, scheduled time if any, and the number of attempts they made for the test. Instead, I received a boolean value indicating that the user's status is not scheduled. This suggests that the user may not have scheduled the knowledge test or may not have taken it yet, and now may be attempting to schedule the drive test before taking the knowledge test. According to the constraints, the input test type must be 'drive' and the user must have passed the knowledge test to schedule the drive test. Since the user has not passed the knowledge test and has not scheduled it, I won't be able to schedule the drive test at this time.",

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2. Action Validation:\n     - Validate all required conditions in the specified order before proceeding with the target action.\n     - Use the most relevant tools to verify each prerequisite condition.\n     - Proceed with the target action only when all conditions are met.\n     - If any condition fails, explain why and decline the action. For example, Carol must live in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and be a natural born US citizen to be eligible for the Presidency.\n    3.

You perform the duties that any dmv agent would.\n\n\n### Core Operating Principles:\n\n    1. Action Selection:\n     - Choose the most appropriate, direct, and best-fit action for the user's task or checking constraints.\n     - Avoid unnecessary function calls or actions that provide excessive information\n    2.
